## Scenario

The CTO for Contoso Corp has met with senior leadership and they are excited about the migration of the application to Azure. Now that the application is running successfully in Azure, they would like to update the application. At the last technical conference, they were told that the PaaS services in Azure will make their application more agile with features such as continuous deployment. They would like to leverage this so that you can quickly and easily update the application. The senior leadership has decided on four high-priority goals they should be done ASAP.
