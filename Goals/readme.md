# Hackathon Goals

Your objectives in this hackathon are related to the implementation of new features that aligns with senior leadership's four high-priority goals:

## [Agility](/Goals/Agility/)

  The web application should be quick and easy to update. The company believe that updates should not require human intervention but instead should happen any time the “gold” source code changes. They have read whitepapers on continuous deployment and believe this is the way forward.

## [Search](/Goals/Search/)

  Today, each event is listed in chronological order. As Contoso Corp grows, it will become increasingly difficult to find specific events. They believe that it is time to create a search page. They would like the search page to allow them to find events even if they don’t know all of the letters for the full name of an event. Also, they would like to expose a public-facing API so that app developers and the public can query their events in a controlled environment.

## [Security](/Goals/Security/)

  Contoso Corp is collecting sensitive data about each event registrant and the company would prefer to implement strong security measures now instead of waiting until after a breach. The company still would like to implement Azure Active Directory for the management site, but they also want the users to be able to use Multi-Factor Authentication. For the registration data, the company would like to protect registrant e-mails so they are not accidentally exposed. The company would also like to encrypt data whenever possible.
